##  Key Enhancements & Refactoring

While the core business logic is inspired by the tutorial, I have modernized the infrastructure and development workflow:

- **🐘 Build System Migration (Gradle):** Migrated the entire project from Maven to **Gradle** for faster build times and better dependency management.
- **🗄️ Database Migrations (Liquibase):** Implemented **Liquibase** with **YAML** changelogs to manage database schema changes and version control professionally.
- **📑 API Documentation (Swagger):** Integrated **Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI)** for interactive API testing and automatic documentation.
- **mj Modular Project Structure:** Refactored the codebase into a cleaner, more scalable package structure (separation of concerns).
